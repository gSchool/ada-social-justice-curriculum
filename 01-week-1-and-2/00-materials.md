# Resources 

As you kick off your pre-cohort equity curriculum, we will focus on big picture concepts, frameworks, and
shared language that will support weeks 3-6. During these first two weeks, we will create a common foundation
and entry point for Ada community members into our equity framework. We will explore the overarching
question: What is the "water we swim in" and how have we been impacted?
* Align on commonly used equity terms, and begin exploring what we already know and need to learn
more about
* Introduction to a macro level framework for contextualizing how power and oppression manifest
* Explore the ways our identities have been socialized over our lifetime
* Dive into how this socialization has impacted ourselves and those we engage with
